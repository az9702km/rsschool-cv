### About
My main goal is to contribute to the development of the web industry, thus making people's lives better. I worked as an intern in a web studio and also worked as a freelancer and participated in several projects as a front-end developer. For more than 3 years I've learnt a lot and here is a bunch of skills I've mastered so far:

##### Soft skills
- Listening
- Critical thinking
- Problem solving
- Honesty and Humorous
- Collaboration

##### Hard skills

- UX/UI design
- HTML&CSS, Sass
- Bootstrap and plugins (owl-carousel, datatable and so on)
- Git basics
- Basic OOP
- CSS methodologies (BEM and OOCSS)

### Code example

```js
function squareDigits(num){
  let con = "";
  let s = num.toString();
  for(let i=0; i<s.length; i++){
    con+=Math.pow(parseInt(s[i]),2);
  }
  return parseInt(con);
}
```

### Work experience
In 2017 I've been applied as an internship in Padnasoft web studio and worked for one year. Due to my university attendance I had to quit the job and rarely made for living in freelancing.

### Education
Last year I've graduated Tashkent University of Information Technologies and got bachelor degree in computer science.

### English language
My english degree is between intermediate and upper intermediate, I've attended lessons in local learning centers.
